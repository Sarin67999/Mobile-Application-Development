# CAPSTONE PROJECT : Mobile App Development Using .NET MAUI
# SUDOKU GAME

Our capstone project is a collaborative effort by Robert, Sarin, and Adit, designed to bring the classic Sudoku puzzle to life using .NET MAUI. The primary objective was to create a mobile game that is easy to use, enjoyable, and visually engaging while showcasing our ability to develop cross-platform applications.

# Project Highlights: 
*  User-Centric Design:
          We focused on crafting a neat and intuitive interface, ensuring that players of all skill levels can easily navigate and enjoy the game.
* Progress Saving:
           A convenient save feature allows users to pause their game and continue at their leisure, adding flexibility to their experience.
* Assistive Features: 
            For those tricky moments, the game includes a hint system to help players overcome challenges without losing momentum.
